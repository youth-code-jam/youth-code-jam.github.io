			 You need to teach
		 	them what is right and wrong. 
			If you do not do this you will
			 have a very naughty cat! It is
			  also important 
			to have a climbing structure 
			or a lot of toys.Introduce family
			 mebers slowly and carefully, you do
			  not want to scare your cat.Pick a name 
			  for the cat after you get it, so you can 
			  see its personalaty.  </p>

			<h2> A Darker Shade of Magic </h2>
			<p> Kell is one of the last Antari—magicians with
			a rare, coveted ability to travel between parallel
			Londons; Red, Grey, White, and, once upon a time, Black. 
			Kell was raised in Arnes—Red London—and officially 
			serves the Maresh Empire as an ambassador, traveling between
			the frequent bloody regime changes in White London and the 
			court of George III in the dullest of Londons, the one without
			any magic left to see.Unofficially, Kell is a smuggler, 
			servicing people willing to pay for even the smallest glimpses
			of a world they'll never see. It's a defiant hobby with 
			dangerous consequences, which Kell is now seeing firsthand.
			After an exchange goes awry, Kell escapes to Grey London and 
			runs into Delilah Bard, a cut-purse with lofty aspirations. 
			She first robs him, then saves him from a deadly enemy, and 
			finally forces Kell to spirit her to another world for a 
			proper adventure.Now perilous magic is afoot, and treachery 
			lurks at every turn. To save all of the worlds, they'll first
			need to stay alive.

			<h2> Artemis Fowl </h2>
			<p>Twelve-year-old Artemis Fowl is a millionaire, a genius, 
			and above all, a criminal mastermind. But even Artemis doesn't
			know what he's taken on when he kidnaps a fairy, Captain Holly
			Short of the LEPrecon Unit. These aren't the fairies of bedtime 
			stories—they're dangerous! Full of unexpected twists and turns, 
			Artemis Fowl is a riveting, magical adventure.

			<h2> A Series of Unfortunate Events </h2>
			<p>No one can balance absurdity and tragedy quite like Lemony Snicket.
			His talents are on full display in A Series of Unfortunate Events,
			thirteen unrelentingly dark yet deliciously readable books about the
			luckless Baudelaire children. Their troubles begin with their parents’
			deaths and their adoption by Count Olaf, the notorious (albeit ridiculous)
			villain of the series who assumes a new identity in each book — all in 
			pursuit of the Baudelaires’ vast fortune, which always seems just out of
			reach. This is the one shred of luck the children do have, as they’re 
			repeatedly forced into miserable situations with various odd caretakers,
			and have little success uncovering the secrets behind their parents’ 
			deaths (and the mysterious organization, V.F.D., to which they belonged).

			<h2> Bridge to Terabithia </h2>
			<p>Summer vacation was not everything Jess Aarons hoped it would be, but
			there’s a treat waiting for him with the return of the school year: the 
			opportunity to race his classmates and leave them all in his dust. He’s
			been practicing all summer and is pretty confident in his ability to pick
			up speed. And he would have won, if not for Leslie Burke, a new girl in
			school, who easily outruns everyone, including Jess. Post-race, it doesn’t
			seem like the two are on the verge of becoming BFFs. But they eventually 
			discover they share more in common than the need for speed: imagination and
			love of fantasy. Together, Jess and Leslie create a magical kingdom in the 
			woods called Terabithia — a place they can run and play, and where anything
			feels possible. </p>
			<img src="Cinder.jpg" width= "400" height="500" alt="Book Cover" />
			<h2> Cinder (Lunar Chronicles)</h2>
			<p>With this first installment in her series of quirky, sci-fi takes on 
			classic fairy tales, Marissa Meyer invites readers into the world of Cinder:
			a cyborg living in the future city of New Beijing and repairing broken 
			machines to support herself. She lives (of course) with her stepmother and 
			stepsisters — until one day when her world is upended by one sister falling
			ill to a plague. In a quick sequence of events, Cinder finds herself being 
			studied by the royal doctors, and swept up in a world of imperial politics 
			and a looming war with the Lunar colonies. Add in a charming robot sidekick 
			and the requisite swoony prince, and you’ve got a futuristic fairytale sure 
			to entertain all the way to the moon and back. </p>
			<img src="cityofbones.jpg" alt="Book Cover" />
			<h2> City of Bones (The Mortal Instruments)</h2>
			<p> For anyone who doesn’t know, City of Bones is part of the Shadowhunters 
			universe, a multi-series fantasy saga that encompasses (to date) fifteen novels
			across four series, three volumes of related short stories, four graphic novels,
			as well as the requisite movie and TV show adaptations — with plenty more still 
			to come. This first book follows Clary: a seemingly ordinary girl in New York 
			City whose life is turned upside-down when she stumbles upon the world of the 
			Shadowhunters, humans with angel blood who are tasked with keeping the world safe
			from demons and other magical beings. It’s an exciting introduction to an enormous
			urban fantasy world, full of action, adventure, and romance, and has become an 
			important part of many teenagers’ reading histories since its release in 2007.
			</p>
			<img src="Divergent.jpg" alt="Book Cover" />
			<h2> Divergent </h2>
			<p> Divergent is one of those few. Set in an alternate-future Chicago, society is 
			divided into five factions: Abnegation, valuing selflessness; Amity, valuing peace;
			Erudite, valuing knowledge; Candor, valuing honesty; and Dauntless, valuing bravery.
			You might think of them like Hogwarts Houses, only the stakes are a lot higher, and 
			the divisions a lot sharper. But what happens when someone fails to fit neatly in one
			box? </p>
			<img src= "Gone.jpg" alt="Book Cover"/>
			<h2> Gone</h2>
			<p> In the blink of an eye, everyone disappears. Gone. Except for the young. There are
			teens, but not one single adult. Just as suddenly, there are no phones, no internet, no
			television. No way to get help. And no way to figure out what's happened. Hunger threatens.
			Bullies rule. A sinister creature lurks. Animals are mutating. And the teens themselves are
			changing, developing new talents—unimaginable, dangerous, deadly powers—that grow stronger
			by the day. It's a terrifying new world. Sides are being chosen, a fight is shaping up. 
			Townies against rich kids. Bullies against the weak. Powerful against powerless. And time is
			running out: On your 15th birthday, you disappear just like everyone else...</p>

			<h2> Harry Potter</h2>
			<p> From the very first novel, Harry entrances us with his sympathetic tale: abused orphan to
			budding wizard, known throughout the magical community for causing the downfall of He Who Must
			Not Be Named. It’s a big legacy for anyone to live up, much less an eleven-year-old boy — but
			Harry wins over the wizarding world with his big heart and exceptional courage, and watching him
			grow over the course of seven novels is a true delight. These books are truly a magic trick, full
			of instantly memorable characters both good and evil, clever mysteries that take multiple 
			installments to unravel, and the irresistible idea that love can save us all.</p>
			<img src="IANYPMD.jpg" alt="Book Cover"/>
			<h2> I'm not your perfect Mexican daughter</h2>
			<p> Fifteen-year-old Julia Reyes knows she isn’t her parents’ favorite daughter. That would be Olga,
			who helped their Amá clean houses, showed up faithfully to church each Sunday, and went to community
			college so she could live at home. Sweet-natured and devout, she was every bit the perfect Mexican 
			daughter that brash, inquisitive Julia can’t seem to be. So when Olga dies in a car accident, aged 
			twenty-two, she becomes enshrined in familial memory as something of a saint. I Am Not Your Perfect
			Mexican Daughter offers a sharply rendered portrait of a complicated grief. As Julia mourns, she 
			clashes with parents who seem determined to remold her in the likeness of her dead sister — a sister
			who, it turns out, was far more complicated than the blameless Saint Olga of memory. Can Julia unravel
			the truth of Olga’s life and find her own place in a family that can’t seem to let her be herself? </p>
			<img src="KOTLC.jpg" width="400" height="500" alt="Book Cover"/>
			<h2> Keeper of the Lost Cities</h2>
			<p>Twelve-year-old Sophie Foster has a secret. She’s a Telepath—someone who hears the thoughts of 
			everyone around her. It’s a talent she’s never known how to explain. Everything changes the day she meets
			Fitz, a mysterious boy who appears out of nowhere and also reads minds. She discovers there’s a place she
			does belong, and that staying with her family will place her in grave danger. In the blink of an eye, 
			Sophie is forced to leave behind everything and start a new life in a place that is vastly different from 
			anything she has ever known. Sophie has new rules to learn and new skills to master, and not everyone is 
			thrilled that she has come “home.” There are secrets buried deep in Sophie’s memory—secrets about who she 
			really is and why she was hidden among humans—that other people desperately want. Would even kill for.

			<h2> Maze Runner </h2>
			<p><b> If you ain't scared, you ain't human.</b></p>
			<p> When Thomas wakes up in the lift, the only thing he can remember is his name. He’s surrounded by strangers
			—boys whose memories are also gone.</p>
			<p><b> Nice to meet ya, shank. Welcome to the Glade.</b></p>
			<p>Outside the towering stone walls that surround the Glade is a limitless, ever-changing maze. It’s the only
			way out—and no one’s ever made it through alive.</p>
			<p><b>Everything is going to change.</b></p>
			<p> Then a girl arrives. The first girl ever. And the message she delivers is terrifying.</p>
			<p> Remember. Survive. Run.</p>
			<img src="MCGOA.jpg" alt="Book Cover"/>
			<h2> Magnus Chase and the Gods of Asgard</h2>
			<p> Magnus Chase has seen his share of trouble. Ever since that terrible night two years ago when his mother told
			him to run, he has lived alone on the streets of Boston, surviving by his wits, staying one step ahead of the
			police and the truant officers. One day, Magnus learns that someone else is trying to track him down—his uncle 
			Randolph, a man his mother had always warned him about. When Magnus tries to outmaneuver his uncle, he falls right
			into his clutches. Randolph starts rambling about Norse history and Magnus's birthright: a weapon that has been lost
			for thousands of years. The more Randolph talks, the more puzzle pieces fall into place. Stories about the gods of 
			Asgard, wolves, and Doomsday bubble up from Magnus's memory. But he doesn't have time to consider it all before a fire
			giant attacks the city, forcing him to choose between his own safety and the lives of hundreds of innocents. . . .</p>
			<p> Sometimes, the only way to start a new life is to die.</p>
			<img src="Monster.jpg" alt="Book Cover"/>
			<h2> Monster</h2>
			<p> Published in 1999, Monster was a revelation in a genre — and an industry — where very few books starred protagonists
			of color. Cleverly structured and rich in suspense, it tells the story of sixteen-year-old Steve Harmon’s trial for murder.</p>
			<p>The text shifts between Steve’s diary entries and his in-progress screenplay — a way to use his passion for film to 
			document the traumas inflicted by a broken legal system. Needless to say, this is a YA novel of tremendous complexity — both
			in the intricacy of its structure, and in its sensitive handling of topics from racial justice to the carceral state. The 
			prosecutor paints Steve as a “monster,” a callous criminal unashamed to look the other way when his coconspirators turn to 
			murder in an armed robbery gone wrong. To his film teacher, however, he’s a young man with tremendous artistic potential and
			a good heart. Not even Steve knows who he really is — not anymore. No matter what the final verdict, can he hold onto his sense
			of his own humanity?</p>
			<img src="PJO.jpg" alt="Book Cover"/>
			<h2> Percy Jackson and the Olympians </h2>
			<p>Rick Riordan’s trailblazing YA fantasy series kicks off with one of the best premises this side of the millennium: 
			twelve-year-old Percy Jackson discovering he is the son of Poseidon. This revelation leads him to Camp Half-Blood, where Percy 
			adjusts to his new identity and meets fellow demigod kids. Along with his friends Luke and Annabeth, Percy soon embarks on a 
			perilous quest to recover Zeus’ master lightning bolt, the disappearance of which has thrown Olympus into chaos. And this is 
			only the beginning of the gripping Percy Jackson pentalogy, which is chock full of nail-biting suspense and enthralling mythological
			adaptation. </p>
			<img src="redqueen.jpg" alt="Book Cover"/>
			<h2> Red Queen</h2>
			<p> This is a world divided by blood - red or silver. The Reds are commoners, ruled by a Silver elite in possession of god-like 
			superpowers. And to Mare Barrow, a seventeen-year-old Red girl from the poverty-stricken Stilts, it seems like nothing will ever
			change. That is until she finds herself working in the Silver Palace. Here, surrounded by the people she hates the most, Mare 
			discovers that, despite her red blood, she possesses a deadly power of her own. One that threatens to destroy the balance of power.
			Fearful of Mare's potential, the Silvers hide her in plain view, declaring her a long-lost Silver princess, now engaged to a Silver
			prince. Despite knowing that one misstep would mean her death, Mare works silently to help the Red Guard, a militant resistance 
			group, and bring down the Silver regime. But this is a world of betrayal and lies, and Mare has entered a dangerous dance - Reds 
			against Silvers, prince against prince, and Mare against her own heart.</p>
			<img src="Renegades.jpg" alt="Book Cover"/>
			<h2> Renegades</h2>
			<p><b>Secret Identities. Extraordinary Powers. She wants vengeance. He wants justice.</b></p>
			<p> The Renegades are a syndicate of prodigies — humans with extraordinary abilities — who emerged from the ruins of a crumbled society
			and established peace and order where chaos reigned. As champions of justice, they remain a symbol of hope and courage to everyone... 
			except the villains they once overthrew. Nova has a reason to hate the Renegades, and she is on a mission for vengeance. As she gets closer
			to her target, she meets Adrian, a Renegade boy who believes in justice — and in Nova. But Nova's allegiance is to a villain who has the 
			power to end them both.</p>
			<img src="theoutsiders.jpg" width="400" height="500" alt="Book Cover"/>
			<h2> The Outsiders </h2>
			<p> Ponyboy Curtis is a legend in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and in the hearts of the readers who grew up with S.E. Hinton’s The Outsiders. Hinton 
			herself was only 15 when she started writing this classic novel about two warring rival gangs: the working-class “greasers” and the privileged
			“Socs” (short for “socials”). Ponyboy, our protagonist, is a proud greaser who would die for his boys. But he didn’t actually think that 
			mortality was in the cards — until the night that his friend Johnny murders a Soc. The two weeks that ensue will turn Ponyboy’s life — and maybe
			even his entire worldview — upside-down in this precocious book with a beating, emotional heart.</P>
			<img src="TATBILB.jpg" alt="Book Cover"/> 
			<h2> To All the Boys I've Loved Before </h2>
			<p>To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before is the story of Lara Jean, who has never openly admitted her crushes, but instead wrote each boy a letter about
			how she felt, sealed it, and hid it in a box under her bed. But one day Lara Jean discovers that somehow her secret box of letters has been mailed, 
			causing all her crushes from her past to confront her about the letters: her first kiss, the boy from summer camp, even her sister's ex-boyfriend, Josh.
			As she learns to deal with her past loves face to face, Lara Jean discovers that something good may come out of these letters after all.
			</p>
			<img src="The_Ruins_of_Gorlan.jpg" alt="Book Cover"/>
			<h2> The Ruins of Gorlan (Ranger's Apprentice)</h2>
			<p> They have always scared him in the past — the Rangers, with their dark cloaks and shadowy ways. The villagers believe the Rangers practice magic that
			makes them invisible to ordinary people. And now 15-year-old Will, always small for his age, has been chosen as a Ranger's apprentice. What he doesn't yet
			realize is that the Rangers are the protectors of the kingdom. Highly trained in the skills of battle and surveillance, they fight the battles before the
			battles reach the people. And as Will is about to learn, there is a large battle brewing. The exiled Morgarath, Lord of the Mountains of Rain and Night, 
			is gathering his forces for an attack on the kingdom. This time, he will not be denied.... </p>
			<img src="throneofglass.jpg" alt="Book Cover"/>
			<h2> Throne of Glass</h2>
			<p> After serving out a year of hard labor in the salt mines of Endovier for her crimes, 18-year-old assassin Celaena Sardothien is dragged before the Crown
			Prince. Prince Dorian offers her her freedom on one condition: she must act as his champion in a competition to find a new royal assassin. Her opponents are 
			men-thieves and assassins and warriors from across the empire, each sponsored by a member of the king's council. If she beats her opponents in a series of 
			eliminations, she'll serve the kingdom for four years and then be granted her freedom. Celaena finds her training sessions with the captain of the guard, Westfall,
			challenging and exhilarating. But she's bored stiff by court life. Things get a little more interesting when the prince starts to show interest in her ... 
			but it's the gruff Captain Westfall who seems to understand her best. Then one of the other contestants turns up dead ... quickly followed by another. Can Celaena 
			figure out who the killer is before she becomes a victim? As the young assassin investigates, her search leads her to discover a greater destiny than she could
			possibly have imagined. </p>
			<img src="thehateugive.jpg" width="400" height="500" alt="Book Cover"/>
			<h2> The Hate U Give </h2>
			<p> Sixteen-year-old Starr Carter moves between two worlds: the poor neighborhood where she lives and the fancy suburban prep school she attends. The uneasy balance 
			between these worlds is shattered when Starr witnesses the fatal shooting of her childhood best friend Khalil at the hands of a police officer. Khalil was unarmed.
			Soon afterward, his death is a national headline. Some are calling him a thug, maybe even a drug dealer and a gangbanger. Protesters are taking to the streets in
			Khalil’s name. Some cops and the local drug lord try to intimidate Starr and her family. What everyone wants to know is: what really went down that night? And the 
			only person alive who can answer that is Starr. But what Starr does—or does not—say could upend her community. It could also endanger her life. </p>
			<img src="The_Hunger_Games.jpg" alt="Book Cover"/>
			<h2> The Hunger Games</h2>
			<p><b> WINNING MEANS FAME AND FORTUNE.</b></p>
			<p><b> LOSING MEANS CERTAIN DEATH. </b></p>
			<p><b> THE HUNGER GAMES HAVE BEGUN..... </b></p>
			<p> In the ruins of a place once known as North America lies the nation of Panem, a shining Capitol surrounded by twelve outlying districts. The Capitol is harsh and 
			cruel and keeps the districts in line by forcing them all to send one boy and once girl between the ages of twelve and eighteen to participate in the annual Hunger Games
			a fight to the death on live TV. Sixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen regards it as a death sentence when she steps forward to take her sister's place in the Games. But 
			Katniss has been close to dead before—and survival, for her, is second nature. Without really meaning to, she becomes a contender. But if she is to win, she will have to 
			start making choices that weight survival against humanity and life against love. </p>
			<img src="thesixofcrows.jpg" alt="Book Cover"/>
			<h2> Six of Crows </h2>

			<img src="thehobbit.jpg" alt="Book Cover"/>
			<h2> The Hobbit, or There and Back Again </h2>
			<p>In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in
			it to sit down on or to eat: it was a hobbit-hole, and that means comfort. Written for J.R.R. Tolkien’s own children, The Hobbit met with instant critical acclaim when it was
			first published in 1937. Now recognized as a timeless classic, this introduction to the hobbit Bilbo Baggins, the wizard Gandalf, Gollum, and the spectacular world of Middle-earth
			recounts of the adventures of a reluctant hero, a powerful and dangerous ring, and the cruel dragon Smaug the Magnificent. The text in this 372-page paperback edition is based on 
			that first published in Great Britain by Collins Modern Classics (1998), and includes a note on the text by Douglas A. Anderson (2001).</p>

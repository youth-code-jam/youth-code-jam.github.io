going to teach you to draw, sorry but no. This is about before the drawing and thinking 
"How will I imagine this character" first off, this character is about you. Think about all
the things that make you, you. Like your favorite color and/or animal. Mine is a Deer and 
my favorite color is Pink, so I made my character named Deer Devil. Similar to the word 
Dare Devil since I like to do dangerous things (sometimes). Don't worry you can fudge one 
thing and one thing only.
This is about you, yourself, and you personally. Take a few minutes to think of a name and 
what your character would look like. If you can draw, then create what makes your heart at 
best. You think you're done? You still have a few steps, like props, fears, and things that  
would make your character handy. Deer Devil's prop is a clothes hanger and scissors, and  
yet her greatest fear is getting cut. You see? That's what makes her so unique in the 
character world. If you've thought it through and are happy about then I hope I was helpful.
BTW, there's a scratch of Deer Devil with the Triple Threats Gang (It's not a real gang, 
it's the main group of characters with my friends)

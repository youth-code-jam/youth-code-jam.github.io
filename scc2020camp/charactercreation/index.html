	<p>Hi,im here to help you invision a character based on anything you want to be you may wonder why you want to be someone else maybe the character you  want is braver than you its fine i dont judge im just here to help.</p>
	<p>The first thing you may want to do is makeup a name this can be any name but be wild like this may sound rude but i dont care what name you come up with like be you it can be really weird but dont you think Wolfertwolf isn't weird now it's YOUR character not mine so who am i to judge.</p>
	<p>Let me tell you that when i first met my two bestfriends Majic chicken and Deer devil well her name wasn't deer devil when we first created our characters it was foxy moxy but i dont into that, at school i didn't have friends of course i was new to the school moved that summer some girls gave me hard time had a bad teacher in general she was mean she was failing me for no reason like when i changed classes i became an A honor roll also didn't help about being "weird" but when i remember that i had  deer devil and magic chicken i all of a sudden wasn't weird and no we are not furry's so dont think that we dont dress up lol but if you have felt like that im here to say you aint alone. </p>
	<p>Now lets get into Wolfertwolf she is annoying, has a weird voice, very sarcastic, and can be like a little kid her thoughts just spill out without her thinking about being rude, im excited to see your characters.</p>

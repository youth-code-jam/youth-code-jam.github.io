       <p>Globally there are more honey bees than other types of bee and pollinating insects, so it is the world's most important pollinator of food crops. It is estimated that one third of the food that we consume each day relies on pollination mainly by bees, but also by other insects, birds and bats.</p>
        
    <p>Honey bees are the only bee in the genus Apis in Texas. Honey bees have several varieties or races and have been bred for honey production, temperament and resistance to disease.</p>

    <p3> A neonicotinoid is a systemic agricultural insecticide resembling nicotine. They are very harmful to the ecosystem, especially bees. The impact of this class of insecticides on pollinating insects such as honey bees and native bees is a.  matter of concern.  Because they are systemic chemicals absorbed by the plant, neonicotinoids can be present in pollen and nectar, making them toxic to pollinators that feed on them.  The potentially long-lasting presence of neonicotinoids in plants, while useful from a pest management point of view, enables these chemicals to harm pollinators even when the initial application is made weeks before the flowering period.</p>

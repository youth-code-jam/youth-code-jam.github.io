		<h2>What is Mental Health?</h2>
			<p>Mental health is defined as a persons emotional, pyshioclogical, and social well-being. Factors that are taken into account
			when determing one's mental health are family history, previous traumatic experiences, and/or the biology of your body. It also
			helps determine how we handle stress, relate to others, and make healthy choices. Unlike some may believe, there is a notable 
			difference between having poor mental health and having a mental illness/disorder. A person can experience poor mental health but not
			be diasgnosed with a mental disorder just as someone with a mental disorder can feel a moment of mental well-being. </p>
